# Ozma's Oddities
A small collection of extremely niche triggers and entities. Please use the issues tab for bugs and feature requests. I'm also open to PRs.

## Entities / Controllers
* **Spotlight Controller:** Change the color, duration, and sound effects of the intro and outro spotlight wipe, or disable it completely! If you disable it the map just starts right away with no warning!

* **Unpause Controller:** Unpauses the game when a flag is set, and prevents pausing if the flag is already set. Made for tart.

* **Parallax Decal:** Gives your decals custom parallax values in two different dimensions without ever touching a decal registry again. 

* **Idle Sound Controller:** Allows you to mute one or more of Madeline's idle sounds. Applies to scratching, sneezing, and knuckle cracking.

* **Snapshot Controller:** Allows you to disable the snapshots which lower the music volume during dialog and pausing.

## Triggers
* **Music Fade To Trigger:** Fade any music parameter you want without specifying a starting value. It will just start wherever it's already at. Useful for situations where a parameter value can vary arbitrarily.

* **Darkness Fade To Trigger:** Just like the music fade to trigger, but for darkness alpha. Includes a bonus "Revert on Leave" option that is useful in zero situations.

* **Flag if Param Trigger:** Sets a flag if a music parameter is set to a specific value. I don't even remember why I made this!

* **Alt Music Trigger:** Exactly like the Alt Music Trigger that comes bundled with Lönn, except this one only includes tracks that actually work!
